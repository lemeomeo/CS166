## Totient Function
φ(n) is the number of numbers less than n, relatively prime to n. Relatively prime means two numbers that have no common factor other than 1. For example, *7* and *20* are relative primes.

## Lab part 1:

1. 8 and 9 are relative prime, they don't have any common factor other than 1.
2. What is φ(15) ?
	* 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14
	* So φ(15) = 8
3. What is multiplicative of inverse 4 mod 13 ? 
	* Assuming modular multiplicative inverse is x, we want to find x when a . x = 1 (mod m). Substitute in the values, we have (4 * x) mod 13 = 1, therefore x = 10 because 40 mod 13 = 1.

## Lab part 2:

1. Private key (General superincreasing knapsack) SIK = (3,4,9,21,45,96, 199, 402) 
m = 32, n = 1215. Find the public key
3 . 32 mod 1215 = 96
4 . 32 mod 1215 = 128
9 . 32 mod 1215 = 288
21 . 32 mod 1215 = 672
45 . 32 mod 1215 = 225
96 . 32 mod 1215 = 642
199 . 32 mod 1215 = 293
402 . 32 mod 1215 = 714
Public key is (96, 128, 288, 672, 225, 642, 293, 714)
2. Calculate P=00101110
288 + 225 + 642 + 293 = 1448
3. Decrypt P=00101110
(1448 . 38) mod 1215 = 349
Use 349 to trace along SIK {3,4,9,21,45,96, 199, 402} = **00101110**.

## Lab part 3:

1. p = 107, q = 293
Calculate the modulus N with p and q. Use e=3. What is the public key? 
Let N = pq = 31351 be the modulus
Choose e relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1) = (106)(292) = 30952
φ(30952) = 14976. Therefor the public key is:

> (31351, 3)

2. (p-1)(q-1) = (106)(292) = 30952
Find d such that 3.d = 1 mod 30952 => d = 20635
3. Encrypt message M = 42 with the public key. Find C.
Formula : C = M^e mod N
42^3 mod 31351 = 11386 = C
4. Decrypt M, know that M = C^d mod N
M = 11386^20635 mod 31351 = (big number) mod 31351
5. If Trudy figure out p, and she also get access to public key N by default. She can essentially figure out d, which is the private key. And from there Trudy can figure out pretty much everything else.
